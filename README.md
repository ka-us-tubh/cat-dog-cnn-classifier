# Cat-Dog CNN Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier using the concept of data augmentation and transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG model. The goal is to create a model capable of classifying images as either a cat or a dog.

## CNN Architecture

The CNN architecture used in this project is based on the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model, which is known for its simplicity and effectiveness. The VGG model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing images. This helps in improving the generalization ability of the model and reducing overfitting.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models trained on large datasets and fine-tuning them for a specific task. In this project, we use a pre-trained VGG model as the base model and fine-tune it for our cat-dog classification task.


## Files Included

1. `cnn_architecture.png`:Jupyter file for training the CNN classifier and evaluation of the trained model.
2. `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project and how to use it.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow (for deep learning)
- Keras (high-level neural networks API)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- OpenCV (for image processing)

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python
```

## Note

- Ensure that your dataset is well-prepared and labeled correctly with separate folders for cats and dogs.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters, data augmentation techniques, and CNN architectures to improve the model's performance.
